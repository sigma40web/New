/**
 * Per-dependency status reporting.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MISSING. `readiness()` answers one question — may this instance take traffic — and it answers
 * it with a flat list of checks whose optionality is decided by the CALLER (`opts.optional`). That is
 * enough for a load balancer and not enough for an operator: nothing declared which components exist,
 * which of them are required, or how to tell "deliberately switched off" from "broken". A disabled
 * subsystem reported as `degraded` teaches operators to ignore `degraded`.
 *
 * THE MODEL. Each component declares its own `required` flag once, in `DEPENDENCIES` below, and reports
 * one of six stable states. The rules that follow from that declaration are the point of the module:
 *
 *   * a REQUIRED component in `unavailable` (or `starting`) fails readiness;
 *   * an OPTIONAL component in `degraded` or `unavailable` never fails readiness — it makes the report
 *     `degraded`, which is a signal, not an outage;
 *   * `disabled` is an intentional configuration, so it is neither an error NOR a degradation. This is
 *     the distinction that makes the field useful: if switching a subsystem off produced the same
 *     `degraded` signal as that subsystem breaking, operators would learn to ignore `degraded`;
 *   * `draining` is reported for the components that have a drain phase, and fails readiness for the
 *     process that is draining, because a draining process must stop being given work while remaining
 *     LIVE. Liveness is answered from process state and never consults this module.
 *
 * SAFETY. A probe returns a state and a code, never an exception. Every explanation is chosen from the
 * closed `DependencyCode` set plus a bounded, sanitized detail; no driver error, connection string,
 * credential, SQL text, stack trace or internal URL can reach a caller, because the probe result is
 * constructed from the closed set rather than from the thrown value. `summarize` bounds the component
 * count and the detail length so the output of an unauthenticated probe endpoint stays small.
