/**
 * Readiness checks that fail for the reasons that actually matter.
 *
 * `/ready` used to run `SELECT 1`. That proves the pool can reach *a* database, which is the smallest
 * possible fraction of "this instance can safely serve traffic". Every check below exists because the
 * failure it catches would otherwise present as working:
 *
 *   - MIGRATIONS BEHIND. The code expects tables and functions a stale database does not have, so the
 *     first real request fails instead of the health check. A deployment that rolls forward the app
 *     before the migration job finishes must be caught here, not by a user.
 *   - SCHEMA AHEAD. The database has migrations this build does not know about, which is a rollback that
 *     left the schema in front of the code. Serving traffic then risks writing rows the newer schema's
 *     invariants are meant to constrain.
 *   - LEDGER TAMPERED. An applied migration's recorded hash no longer matches the file, so this
 *     database's schema is not the one this build was tested against.
 *   - ROLE ASSUMPTIONS VIOLATED. If the application role is missing, or is a superuser, or can bypass
 *     RLS, then every tenant-isolation guarantee in ADR-0050 is void while the app looks perfectly
 *     healthy. This is the check that would have caught a misconfigured cluster.
 *
 * LIVENESS vs READINESS is kept distinct on purpose: liveness must NOT fail because an optional external
 * dependency is down, or a transient provider outage would cause an orchestrator to kill healthy
 * processes and turn a degraded system into an outage.
