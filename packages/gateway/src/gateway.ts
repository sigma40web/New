   *    usage it never reported is `unknown`, not zero. A missing token count and a real zero are
   *    different facts and only one of them is safe to sum.
   *  * billing — `billing_status` is `known` only when priced usage exists. An aborted socket is not
   *    evidence that nothing will be billed.

   * Cost stays integer-safe: it reuses the same `costCents` arithmetic as every other row, so the
